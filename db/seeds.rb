        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        Drinking faster and then we talk slow
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand, stop
        Put Van The Man on the jukebox
        And then we start to dance
        And now I'm singing like
        
        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        I may be crazy, don't mind me
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now, follow my lead
